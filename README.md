# 🔱 ODIN Terminal | Final GitHub Build (Feb 2026)

ODIN Terminal is a production-ready financial UI designed to bridge the gap between institutional data visualization and AI-driven neural intelligence. 



## 🛠️ Integrated Core Systems
* **Neural Ticker Bar:** A real-time market data simulation streaming global asset prices.
* **TV-Engine:** Integrated **TradingView Lightweight Charts** for high-performance candlestick rendering.
* **Ragnarok Countdown:** A real-time countdown to the New York Market lunch lull (12:00 PM EST).
* **Tiered Sovereignty UI:** A four-rank pricing hierarchy (Drengr, Einherjar, Valkyrie, All-Father) with divine hover states.

## 📊 Strategic Pricing Architecture
All plans are mathematically anchored to be **15% more affordable** than standard 2026 benchmarks:
* **Drengr ($12.70):** Entry-level honorable trading.
* **Valkyrie ($50.95):** The divine guide with **Cyan Shimmer** selection.
* **All-Father ($149.95):** Absolute market omniscience with **Golden Pulse** selection.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment
